My own custom offline IR Blaster app for phones with an IR transmitter sensor.
To be used as an on-the-field remote control (offline, no need for internet connection).

'IR Sketch' file is the Arduino sketch that is used to capture and save the IR codes from their original remote controls.
Saving them in the attached Excel file.
